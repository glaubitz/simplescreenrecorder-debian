Description: Screen recorder for X11 and OpenGL
 Simple Screen Recorder is, despite its name, an actually quite complex
 piece of software. The name reflects the fact that it is simple to use
 unlike many other free screen recording applications available. It can
 be easily configured to start recording from an intuitive wizard-like
 interface. To perform an X11 recording, all it takes is selecting an
 area on the root window with the mouse, choosing an output file and
 pressing record, either by using the mouse or using a hotkey.
 .
 Its complexity becomes apparent in its powerful features. It allows one
 to record X11 screen areas and fullscreen OpenGL applications including sound
 supporting both ALSA, PulseAudio and JACK. It uses libavformat to encode
 the recorded material into a variety of video formats. Scaling the recorded
 video is possible as well as configuring the encoding quality for the codec
 chosen directly from the user interface.
